simple wasd keypad with volume control, led lights and a special key
## Design Process
i wanted to make a keyboard that i could use so i thought i should make a wasd keypad that i can use to ply games. the process was very long and tiring but it was kinda fun. i thought to add extra stuff like leds, a volume knob and an extra key just because i didnt want it to be basic.

i had practiced using kiCAD beforehand so creating the pcb wasnt such a hard process

## Case
i made the case using fusion360 and it took so long and was not hard but my computer kept lagging so it was kind of annoying but i am so glad i had the guide to help out and make the process easier.

here is a picutre of my case:
